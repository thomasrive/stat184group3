##A.1 How Long

```{r}
Trips %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = client, y = as.numeric(edate-sdate)/60)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  ylim(0,60) +
  ylab("dur/60")

```

##A.2 When are Bikes Used

```{r Density plot for Day of the Year}
Trips %>%
  mutate(DoY = lubridate::yday(sdate))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = DoY))+
  geom_density(fill="gray", adjust = 2) +
  xlab("Day of the Year")

```

```{r Density plot for day of the week}
Trips %>%
  mutate(DoW = lubridate::wday(sdate))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = DoW))+
  geom_density(fill = "blue", adjust = 2)+
  xlab("Day of the Week")
```

```{r Density plot for hour of the day}
Trips %>%
  mutate(Hour = lubridate::hour(sdate))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Hour))+
  geom_density(fill = "red", adjust = 2)+
  xlab("Hour")

```

```{r Density plot for minute of the day}
Trips %>%
  mutate(Min = lubridate::minute(sdate))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Min))+
  geom_density(fill = "green", adjust = 2)+
  xlab("Minute of the Day")
```

```{r Frequnecy by hour, weekday, and clientype}
Trips%>%
  mutate(hour = lubridate::hour(sdate))%>%
  mutate(wday = lubridate::wday(sdate))%>%
  group_by(hour, wday, client)%>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=hour, y = count)) +
  geom_line(aes(linetype = client), na.rm = TRUE)+
  facet_wrap(~wday)

```

```{r Density by hour, weekday, and clientype}
Trips%>%
  mutate(hour = lubridate::hour(sdate))%>%
  mutate(wday = lubridate::wday(sdate))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=hour)) +
  geom_density(aes(colour = client), adjust = 2)+
  facet_wrap(~wday)
```

##A.4
```{r}
library(leaflet)
stationMap <-
  leaflet(Stations) %>%
  addTiles()%>%
  addCircleMarkers(radius = 2, color = "red") %>%
  setView(-77.04,38.9,zoom = 12)
